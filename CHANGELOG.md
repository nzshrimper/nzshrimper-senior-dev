# Changelog

## 0.1.2 — 2026-07-04

- Skill-source selection: every run opens with a four-way choice (own /
  superpowers / combo / suggest), saved per-repo in `.senior-dev/skills.json`
  (private by default, one-question share opt-in).
- `find-skills` wired in as a proposal engine for domain-skill gaps; a curated
  `skill-sources.md` gives exact install commands for missing chain plugins,
  with assisted install and the restart caveat stated.
- New `state-cli` subcommands: `skills-config` (show/set/share/unshare) and
  `skill-source`; status and finish now surface the chosen source.
- The process spine and all hard gates are unchanged.
